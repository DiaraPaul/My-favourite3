            <p>Connor Andrew McDavid (born January 13, 1997) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre and captain of the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is considered to be one of the best players in the world by many colleagues and members of the news media.[1][2][3][4][5]

Having been selected first overall by the Oilers in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, McDavid has won the Art Ross Trophy three times as the leading scorer in the league, the Hart Memorial Trophy, given to the player judged most valuable to his team, in 2017 and 2021, and the Ted Lindsay Award three times as the best player voted by other NHL players. Additionally, McDavid is one of only two unanimous Hart Trophy winners in league history, joining Wayne Gretzky.

McDavid grew up in the Toronto area and played hockey there, and was granted "Exceptional Player" status by Hockey Canada, which allowed him to play major junior one year early. He thus joined the Erie Otters of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and spent three years with the Otters before the Oilers selected him in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Internationally McDavid played for the Canadian national junior team at one World U18 Championship, two World Junior Championships, and for the senior team at one World Championship, winning one gold at every level.
